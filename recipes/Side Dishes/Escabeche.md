# Escabeche
## Ingredients
+ 1 small red onion, sliced thin
+ 2 medium carrots, sliced thin
+ 1 large jalape√±o, sliced into thin rings
+ 0.5 tsp ground coriander (or 0.75 tsp coriander seeds)
+ 0.25 tsp (heaping) ground cumin
+ 1.5 cups apple cider vinegar
+ 0.75 cup water
+ 2 tsp sugar
+ 0.5 tsp salt

## Instructions
1. Cut the vegetables and place them in a pint (2 cup) sized mason jar (or two). You can use more or less of each vegetable as desired.
2. If using whole seeds, toast them in a small pot over medium heat until fragrant, approximately 2 minutes.
3. Add the vinegar, water, sugar, and salt to the pot (and add the ground spices here if being used) and bring to a boil.
4. Remove from heat and pour over vegetables, let cool a refrigerate at least 30 mins.

## Notes
+ Coriander and cumin seeds are technically best for pickling, but ground versions are more accessible, they just make the brine cloudy.
