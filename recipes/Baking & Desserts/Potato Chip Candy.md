+ 1 bag of chocolate chips (300g)

2. Author's Note: Since making these, I have heard of people adding crushed peanuts to the recipe. I have also had the recommendation to use cornflakes instead of chips, which is a great idea as it totally cuts down on calories and fat from the ripple potato chips. When I make these again, I am going to leave out the butterscotch chips and add another bag of chocolate chips and add nuts with the potato chips to give it more of a “cuban lunch” chocolate bar kind of a taste.
