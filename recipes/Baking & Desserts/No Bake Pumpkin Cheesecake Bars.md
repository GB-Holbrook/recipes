# No Bake Pumpkin Cheesecake Bars

## Ingredients
- 4 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon pumpkin spice
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 2 ⅓ cup graham cracker crumbs ((350g))
- ⅔ cup butter melted
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream (cold)
- 16 oz cream cheese (room temperature (500g))
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon sea salt
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice (freshly squeezed)
- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- 1 teaspoon pumpkin spice (more if desired)
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream (cold)
- ⅓ cup powdered sugar
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon pumpkin spice

## Directions
1. CRUST Prepare 8" or 9" square baking pan by lining with parchment paper (SEE NOTES). I used 2 strips of parchment paper layer out like a cross to get handles to help me lift the cheesecake out. Mix graham crumbs, sugar, salt, and pumpkin spice in a large bowl. Add melted butter and stir well. Spread crust mixture into the bottom of prepared pan. Pack it tightly with the bottom of a measuring cup or glass. Set aside.
2. CHEESECAKE Beat the heavy whipping cream until stiff peaks. Set aside in fridge. Beat cream cheese, sugar, and salt until completely smooth. Add vanilla, lemon juice, pumpkin, and pumpkin spice. Beat until smooth again. Carefully fold the whipped cream into the cheesecake just until incorporated and no streaks remain. Transfer to cheesecake crust and smooth the top. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. For clean cuts, freeze for 1 hour before cutting.
3. ASSEMBLY Lift the cheesecake out of the pan using the parchment paper. Transfer to a cutting board. Trim any uneven edges and cut into 12 bars (4x3). Wipe the knife clean after each cut. Whip the cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a star tip (I used a Wilton 1M). Pipe swirls on top of each bar. Sprinkle the tops with pumpkin spice and serve.
