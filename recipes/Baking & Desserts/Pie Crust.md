# Pie Crust
## Ingredients
+ 2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
+ 1 cup cold butter, cut into cubes
+ 1 tsp salt
+ 2 Tbsp sugar
+ 1/2 cup ice water, plus a couple more tablespoons

## Instructions
1. In a food processor, mix flour, salt, and sugar together. Then add the cold butter and pulse the food processor until the butter is the size of peas. Slowly add the water until a dough forms. Be careful not to over mix. *Note that the couple extra tablespoons of water is also for this step*.
2. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and divide the dough in half. For each half into a disk about 1 inch thick and wrap it in plastic.
3. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, up to overnight, before rolling out for your favourite pie recipe.

## Notes
+ To freeze: Place wrapped pie discs into a freezer bag for up to 3 months.
+ To thaw: Place dough over night in the refrigerator to thaw.
