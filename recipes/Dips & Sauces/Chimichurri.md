# Chimichurri 
BBQ Chimichurri Chicken

As you might have guessed already, we like our greens, especially herbs. Here we thought we’d showcase one of our most frequently used: cilantro. If you’re not a fan, just give this a try and tell us you don’t love it. Its strong flavor is balanced perfectly by the addition of basil, parsley and a nice kick of jalapeño.

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro (leaves and stems)
- ½ cup fresh basil leaves
- ¼ cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 1 jalapeño pepper
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 3 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 4 whole chicken legs (or 4 drumsticks + 4 thighs)

## Directions:
1. In a blender, combine cilantro, basil, parsley, jalapeño, minced garlic, olive oil and red wine vinegar. Blend until smooth. Transfer half of the chimichurri to a resealable bag; reserve the other half in an airtight container and refrigerate until needed.
2. Add chicken to bag with chimichurri, seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours (and up to 24 hours).
3. Heat barbecue or grill pan to medium-high. Cook marinated chicken, basting with the reserved chimichurri and turning occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F when tested with a meat thermometer. Serve immediately.

 ## Notes
 
+ Tip: The longer you let the chicken marinate, the more rewarding the outcome.
 + Servings: Makes 4 servings
