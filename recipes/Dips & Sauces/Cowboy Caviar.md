# Cowboy Caviar
## Ingredients
### Dip
+ 15 oz black beans
+ 15 oz black-eyed peas, kidney beans or navy beans
+ 15 oz lentils
+ 10 oz corn (frozen or canned)
+ 1 cup fresh cilantro (1/4 - 1/2 dried)
+ 2 bell pepper, diced
+ 3/4 cup red onion, diced
### Sauce
+ 1 tsp chili powder
+ 1/2 tsp kosher salt
+ 1/4 cup sugar
+ 1/2 cup olive oil
+ 1/3 cup white wine vinegar
+ 1 Tbsp fresh lime juice
+ 1/4 tsp garlic powder

## Instructions
1. Rinse and drain the beans and corn. Transfer to a large bowl. 
2. Add the cilantro and the remaining dip ingredients to the bean and corn mixture. Stir to combine.
3. Mix up the dressing ingredients and set aside until ready to serve.
4. Serve cold or at room temperature.

## Notes
+ Add the dressing a few minutes before serving. If it's left too long the vinegar in the dressing will begin to break down the beans and vegetables.
+ Lightly warm the dressing if refrigerated overnight to loosen up the oil or thaw for 1 hour before serving.
