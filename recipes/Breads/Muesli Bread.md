# Muesli Bread

## Ingredients
+ 1 1/2 cups warm water (~100Â° fahrenheit)
+ 3 cups (437g) All Purpose Flour, plus extra for dusting
+ 1/4 cup (36g) whole wheat flour
+ 1 1/2 tsp salt
+ 2 1/4 tsp instant yeast
+ 1/4 cup raisins
+ 1/4 cup raw pumpkin seeds
+ 1/4 cup raw almonds

## Instructions 
1. Combine water, flours, salt and yeast in a large mixing bowl and stir. The result will be a sticky, rough dough. If using a stand mixer, beat at medium speed for about a minute. Otherwise just use a spoon to stir until well combined.
2. Lift the dough out and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover and let rise in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Alternatively, let rise for 2 hours at room temperature and 2 hours in the fridge.
3. While the dough is rising, soak the raisins by placing them in a small bowl and covering with water. Allow to soak for 20 minutes, then drain, pat dry, and set aside. This helps prevent the raisins from popping out of the bread or burning.
4. Once risen, lightly sprinkle the dough with flour and transfer to a floured work surface. Knead a few times and then add pumpkin seeds, almonds and raisins. Knead until just combined, trying to keep the add-ins on the inside of the loaf, or else they get too crisp while baking.
5. Place on parchment lined baking stone or lightly greased baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top, to help keep the dough moist. Let rest for 45-60 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 450 degrees while the dough rests. Place a metal or cast iron pan (not glass, pyrex or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready.
7. When ready to bake, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut 1/2 inch deep.
8. Place bread in oven and carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Expect it to bubble and steam; then close the oven door quickly.
9. Bake the bread for 25-35 minutes or until deep, golden brown - 25 covered, 10 uncovered.
10. Remove the bread from the oven and cool on a rack. Store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temp.

## Notes
+ Use parchment paper to make it easier getting the loaf into or out of the pot.
+ If doubling the recipe leave in for an extra 5-10 minutes covered, and another 5 minutes uncovered.
