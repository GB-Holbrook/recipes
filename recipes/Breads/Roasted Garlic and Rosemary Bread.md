# Roasted Garlic and Rosemary Bread

## Ingredients

### Roasted Garlic
+ 2 heads of Garlic
+ 2 teaspoons Olive Oil
+ salt to taste

### Bread
+ 4 1/2 teaspoons active dry Yeast
+ 2 teaspoons Honey or Sugar
+ 2 1/2 cups warm water (~100° fahrenheit)
+ 1 tablespoon Kosher Salt
+ 4 tablespoons fresh Rosemary
+ 16-20 roasted garlic cloves, roughly chopped
+ 6 cups (946g) All Purpose Flour, plus extra for dusting 
+ 2 tablespoons Olive Oil

## Instructions 

### Roasted Garlic
+ Heat oven to 400°F
+ Trim the top off the head of garlic to expose the cloves inside
+ Place the garlic in a small lidded baking dish
+ Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt
+ Cover garlic and roast for 30-45 minutes or until cloves are soft and lightly browned, remove from oven and let cool before adding to bread dough

### Bread
#### Dough, and First Rise
+ Combine yeast, honey, and warm water in a large mixing bowl or stand mixer with dough hook. Let the yeast proof for about 5 minutes until the mixture is foamy. 
+ Add salt, rosemary and roasted garlic to the bowl 
+ Add flour to the bowl a little at a time and stir with a wooden spoon or stiff spatula until all flour is incorporated and ingredients have just come together to form a slightly shaggy dough
+ Drizzle dough with olive oil and turn to coat all sides. Cover with a clean tea towel and let rise on the counter for about 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size

#### Shape the Dough and Final Rise
+ When the dough has doubled in size, lightly flour a large cutting board.
+ Tip the dough out of the bowl and onto the cutting board. **Do not punch the dough down**! We need to preserve all those nice air bubbles.
+ Pull each corner of the dough into the center of the loaf one at a time as if you're folding an enevelope. Repeat this process 4-5 times until the dough feels relatively stiff, then flip the dough over and lightly twist while putting it towards you across the cutting board until you have a nice round loaf.
+ Flour a proofing basket or a small mixing bowland place your loaf into it, seam side down. Cover with a clean tea towel and let rise for 30 minutes.

#### Heat the Oven
+ While your bread does its final rise, place an empty Dutch oven into your oven and heat to 450°F

#### Bake!
+ When the oven is hot, you're ready to go! Use oven mitts to pull the dutch oven out and remove the lid.
+ Tip your bread dough gently out of the proofing basket back onto your floured cutting board. The seam side should face up this time - that's what gives it a nice crackly look on top. You can tip the bread onto a piece of parchment paper here to  make it easier to lift the bread in and out of your Dutch oven if you like.
+ Very carefully place the bread seam side up into the hot Dutch oven.
+ Using oven mitts, put the lid back on and return to oven
+ Cook for 30 minutes.
+ Using oven mitts, remove lid from Dutch oven and let cook for 10-20 minutes until the bread has deepened in colour and you have a beautiful brown crust.
+ Using oven mitts remove Dutch oven from oven (oven, oven, oven).
+ Remove loaf from Dutch oven and let cool for at least 20 minutes before cutting.

## Notes
+ Use parchment paper to make it easier getting the loaf into or out of the pot.
+ If doubling the recipe leave in for an extra 5-10 minutes covered, and an extra 5 uncovered.
+ Can use 2 Tablespoons of dried Rosemary in place of fresh.
