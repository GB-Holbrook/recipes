# Chicken Stew
## Ingredients
+ 1 Yellow Onion
+ 3 Celery Stalks
+ 4 Garlic Cloves
+ 0.5 Lbs Carrots
+ 1.75 Lbs Chicken Breast
+ 4 Tbsp Flour, divided
+ 2 Tbsp Butter
+ 1 Tbsp Olive Oil
+ 1.5 Lbs Baby Potatoes
+ 1 tsp dried Parsley
+ 0.5 tsp dried Thyme
+ 0.5 tsp dried Rosemary
+ 0.5 tsp dried Sage
+ 0.25 tsp freshly cracked Black Pepper
+ 2 cups Chicken Stock
+ 2 cups Vegetable Stock
+ 1 Tbsp fresh Parsley, chopped

## Instructions
1. Dice the Onion and Celery, mince the Garlic, slice the Carrots (on the bias!), and cut the Baby Potatoes in half.
2. Cut the Chicken into 1-inch pieces. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp of Flour over the Chicken and toss until evenly coated.
3. Add Butter and Olive Oil to a large pot, heat over medium until sizzling.
4. Add Chicken to pot and cook until brown on all sides. (Avoid stirring until browning begins.) Once Chicken is browned and you have a layer of browned flour on the bottom of the pot remove chicken to a bowl using a slotted spoon - it does not have to be cooked through at this point.
5. Add the Onion, Carrot, Celery, and Garlic and continue to saute until Onions are soft. Use the liquid that is released to scrape the fond from the bottom of the pot. Add some of the stock if required.
6. Once the vegetables are slightly softened add the remaining 2 Tbsp of Flour and continue stirring for approximately 2 minutes or until the Flour begins to stick to the bottom.
7. Return the Chicken to the pot and add the remaining ingredients. Stir to combine and scrape the fond from the bottom of the pot.
8. Place lid on the pot and bring to a boil, then remove the lid and reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and the broth has thickened. Taste and add salt if necessary. Add Parsley if you choose to do so.
