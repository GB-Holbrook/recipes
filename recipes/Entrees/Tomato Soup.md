## Ingredients
- 3 pounds​【1 361 g】 tomatoes, fresh, cut into 2”​【51 mm】 pieces
- ½ onion diced (1 cup)​【237 mL】
- 5 cloves garlic peeled and chopped
- 2 Tablespoons olive oil
- ½ tsp fine sea salt
- ¼ freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ cup​【59 mL】 fresh basil
- 2 Tablespoons salted butter
- 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 quart​【950 mL】 vegetable broth
- Optional: ¼ to ½ cup​【118 mL】 heavy cream.
## Instructions

01. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F​【232°C】. Lightly grease a large baking sheet, set aside.  
02. Combine tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper and stir until evenly distributed.
03. Spread tomato mixture onto prepared baking sheet in a single layer and roast for 15 minutes.
04. Remove from oven, stir, and roast for an additional 15 minutes, broiling during the last 3 minutes so that some of the tomatoes get lightly charred.
05. Add roasted tomato mixture to the container of a high-powered blender, making sure to scrape all the contents of the baking sheet into the blender.
06. Add fresh basil and blend mixture on high speed until smooth (about 50 seconds).
07. In a large pot, melt butter over medium-high heat.
08. Add flour to melted butter and whisk to combine. Cook until butter and flour mixture is golden brown (30-60 seconds).
09. Add broth and sugar and whisk to combine.
10. Add blended mixture to the pot and whisk to combine. If desired (for a creamier soup) add ¼ to ½ cup​【118 mL】 heavy cream. Cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes, taste and adjust salt and pepper as desired.
11. Serve warm with croutons, chopped fresh basil, etc.

## Notes

#### Ingredient Substitution Notes

-   **Tomatoes.** Choose a vine-ripened, naturally sweet tomato variety for the best flavor. 
-   **Onion.** use a sweet white or yellow onion.
-   **Olive Oil.** Any neutral oil works well, my second and third choices would be avocado oil and canola oil. 
-   **Salted Butter.**  Unsalted butter is a good substitute. 
-   **All-purpose flour.** To make this creamy tomato soup gluten-free, use an all-purpose gluten-free flour. 
-   **Granulated sugar.**  brown sugar or honey are good substitutes. 
-   **Vegetable broth.** Chicken broth works well.
-   **Heavy cream.** Whole milk or half and half are great substitutes. 

#### Store

Store any leftover roasted tomato soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 5-7 days. 

#### How to Freeze Tomato Soup

To freeze, let the soup cool to room temperature. Then, transfer the tomato soup to freezer-friendly containers and freeze for up to 2 months. I recommend freezing it in individually-sized portions or at least in portions that you'd eat in a sitting as a family. 

Thaw overnight in the fridge and reheat in a pot on the stove over medium-low heat.
