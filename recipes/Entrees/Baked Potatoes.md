**BEST BAKED POTATOES**

Serves: 4
Total Time: 1 1/4 hours

**RECIPE OVERVIEW**

Baking a potato is about as basic as cooking gets—so basic, in fact, that it doesn't even seem to require a recipe. But following this precise roasting technique guarantees a perfect potato, one with a fluffy interior, deliciously crisp skin, and even seasoning. Our testing pointed us to an ideal doneness temperature: 205 degrees. Baking the potatoes on a wire rack prevents a leathery ring from forming beneath the peel, and using an instant-read thermometer allows you to determine the exact temperature. Coating the potatoes in salty water before baking seasons the skin; brushing on vegetable oil once the potatoes are cooked through and baking for 10 minutes more produces the crispiest exterior possible. It's crucial to cut the potatoes open immediately after baking to allow steam to escape; otherwise, even a perfectly baked potato will be gummy. Top them as desired, or with one of our toppings (recipes follow).

**INGREDIENTS:**

* 2 tablespoons table salt for brining
* 4 small russet potatoes (8 ounces each), unpeeled, each lightly pricked with a fork in 6 places
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat oven:** Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 450 degrees F.
2. **Prepare potatoes:** In a large bowl, dissolve 1 tablespoon of salt in 1/2 cup of water. Add the potatoes to the bowl and toss to coat the exteriors evenly with the salt water.
3. **Bake:** Place the potatoes on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the center of the largest potato registers 205 degrees F (about 45 minutes to 1 hour).
4. **Add oil:** Remove the potatoes from the oven and brush the tops and sides with vegetable oil. Return the potatoes to the oven and continue baking for 10 minutes.
5. **Make slits:** Remove the potatoes from the oven and make 2 slits, forming an X, in each potato.
6. **Fluff:** Using a clean dish towel, hold the ends of the potatoes and squeeze slightly to push the flesh up and out.
7. **Serve:** Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
